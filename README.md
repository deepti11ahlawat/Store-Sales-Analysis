## Task 3: Feature Engineering for Sales Data
## Description
The goal of this task is to **create new features** from the sales dataset to enhance the performance and accuracy of predictive models.  
Feature engineering enables models to capture **seasonal trends, temporal dependencies, and sales patterns** more effectively.

## Workflow

1. **Load** the raw sales dataset.  
2. **Extract** date-related features (Day, Month, Year, Weekday).  
3. **Create** weekend and holiday flags.  
4. **Generate** lag features for past days, weeks, and months.  
5. **Save** the processed dataset as `train_feature_engineering.csv` for model training.

## Dataset processed
The processed dataset used for model training is available below:
